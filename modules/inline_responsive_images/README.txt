DESCRIPTION
-----------
It's not great for the authoring experience nor for structured content reasons
that users are defining the specific dimensions of every single image they insert.
It would be much better to allow them to choose from image styles, just like we do for image fields.
This module lets users select a responsive style OR an image style to place images in the content.
